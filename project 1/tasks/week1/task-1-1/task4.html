        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. 
        It provides the basic structure of a webpage, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies 
        such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. HTML uses a system of tags and attributes 
        to organize and format content, making it essential for web development and design.
