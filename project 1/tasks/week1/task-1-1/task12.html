<p>The chemical formula for water is H<sub>2</sub>O, where H represents hydrogen and O represents oxygen. In this formula, the "2" is a subscript indicating that there are two hydrogen atoms for every one oxygen atom. Additionally, the pH level can be expressed as pK<sub>a</sub> for the acid dissociation constant, which can be influenced by temperature, often denoted as K<sup>Â°C</sup>.</p>
